# ♟️ Modern C++ Chess & Chess Engine

An in-depth **learning and passion project** focused on building a complete chess game from first principles and progressively evolving it into an efficient chess engine using **modern C++ (C++20+)**.

This repository is not a tutorial dump or a finished product — it is a **documented engineering journey** designed to deeply explore:
- modern C++ best practices
- clean software architecture
- algorithmic efficiency
- chess programming fundamentals
- performance-oriented thinking

Unforutnately I will not be exploring openGL in this project but rather SMFL

## Project Goals

- Implement a **fully correct chess game** (rules, move validation, game state)
- Incrementally evolve the project into a **chess engine**
- Learn and apply **modern C++ idioms** and design patterns
- Understand **why** performance techniques work, not just how to apply them

## Use of AI (Important)

AI tools are intentionally used in this project **as learning accelerators, not code writers**.

Specifically:
- ✅ Used for:
  - conceptual explanations
  - design discussions
  - architecture feedback
  - algorithm reasoning
  - performance tradeoff analysis
  - writing this readme lol
- ❌ Not used for:
  - writing implementation code
  - generating full solutions
  - copying engine logic

All implementation decisions and code are **authored manually** to ensure genuine learning and understanding.

## Learning-First Philosophy

This project is:
- **exploratory**
- **iterative**
- **non-linear**

Development may be:
- spontaneous
- refactored frequently
- rewritten as understanding improves

This mirrors real learning and real engineering — not staged perfection.

## Documentation

Documentation is treated as a **first-class artifact**.

All learning notes, design decisions, experiments, and reflections are recorded in: documents/
